### User Input

Create a Wrapped style interacitve web based UI.

All slides mentioned in rewine overall.

Add a relavant before each slide.

Add a intro slide with swipe to open animation.

Animate numbers and incons on each slide. 

### Planner Response

I'll help you create an interactive "Wrapped" style web-based UI with all the features you mentioned. Let me first examine the current HTML file to understand what we're working with.

### Planner Response

I see that I don't have access to the file in your current workspace. Let me ask you about this:

Since I don't have access to the file at [/Users/Puneetkhatri/Documents/workspace/ Overall Rewind - 29 Dec 2025/Rewine Overall.html](cci:7://file:///Users/Puneetkhatri/Documents/workspace/%20Overall%20Rewind%20-%2029%20Dec%202025/Rewine%20Overall.html:0:0-0:0), I have a few options:

1. **Create a new Wrapped-style UI from scratch** in the default project directory (`/Users/Puneetkhatri/.gemini/antigravity/scratch`)
2. **Ask you to copy the HTML file** to a location I can access
3. **Ask you to disable workspace validation** so I can access your current file

Which would you prefer? 

Also, could you clarify what you mean by "All slides mentioned in rewine overall"? Should I:
- Create a typical year-in-review "Wrapped" experience with common slides (intro, stats, achievements, etc.)?
- Or do you have specific slide content in mind?

For the animations, I understand you want:
- ✅ Intro slide with swipe-to-open animation
- ✅ Relevant icons before each slide
- ✅ Animated numbers and icons on each slide

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!

### Planner Response

I'll create a new interactive Wrapped-style UI in your Documents/workspace folder with all the features you requested: haptics, sound, quiz slides, animations, and more!

### Planner Response

I need your help to proceed. I don't have access to `/Users/Puneetkhatri/Documents/workspace/` because it's not in my allowed workspace.

**Could you please do one of the following:**

1. **Disable workspace validation** so I can create files in your Documents/workspace folder
2. **Or** let me create the project in `/Users/Puneetkhatri/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Wrapped-2025` (which I have access to), and you can move it later

Which option would you prefer? Once I have access, I'll create an amazing Wrapped experience with:

- 🎯 **Interactive quiz slides** before each reveal (with blur effects)
- 📱 **Haptic feedback** for interactions
- 🔊 **Sound effects** for transitions and interactions
- 🎨 **Swipe-to-open intro** animation
- ✨ **Animated numbers, icons, and transitions**
- 🎮 **Game-like, premium design** with modern aesthetics

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
